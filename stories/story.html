When they were there a smart student called ashy said "I can fix the bus but it will take me a whole day" . So they set a camp and a flag and the other students except ashy went to collect some food when they were there they saw a alien and they screamed out "alien alien" and came back to camp ashy said "you silly people those are aliens they won't let you steal their food even if it's a worm you forgot that we have Tiffin's in our backpack's we can eat food from them" so they ate food from their Tiffin's when they were done eating it was night.
                      Aliens came and were trying to attack them so they hid one boy did not get to so the aliens were going to attack him ashy bravely took out a rope that was in her backpack and told the boy "catch the rope" so the boy caught the rope and ashy and the other students pulled and pulled and the boy was in the camp tent. they slept but ashy did not she fix the magic school bus the magic school bus said thank you  here you go you can take a thousand dollars and you can do whatever you want with it" Ashy said "ok I will share it with my friends" the bus said "you are a smart and a brave and of course caring I will take you and your friends back home.
