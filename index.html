   <h2>The floor is lava!</h2>
    <p>One day Jane and Lilly were watching a show called The floor is lava
        When they even started to watch they suddenly appeared in the show a voice said "you're in the floor is lava this is a house and you must pass all the rooms and get to the main entrance and get out but remember the floor is lava" then the voice stopped. Jane said "look there are ropes hanging in the ceiling". Then Jane jumped to catch the ropes but she was going to fall Lilly caught her and pulled her and said "the ropes are too far we need to think" Jane got an idea she saw a two benches' she climbed on the bench and on the other that was near to the ropes she told Lilly "look we can jump on the benches' and catch the rope" Lilly jumped on the benches' and caught the rope they swung to the entrance of the room. They went to the other room now Lilly saw a rotating bed and a sofa near to the entrance on the lava she said" look we can jump on the rotating bed then to the sofa then to the entrance of the room. Then they went to the other room now Jane saw a some doors leading to the entrance she told Lilly " look we can jump on the doors and go to the entrance  they jump on the doors and got to the entrance.
        
        When they entered the other room it was even harder. There were ropes closer to them but away from each other Jane thought and told Lilly "remember that we learned in our class today that team work is everything we can do team work I will go and hang in the first rope then you hang on my leg and you will swing on the other an then I will swing to the other and we will be in the entrance. So they did it and they were standing in the entrance.
        
        When they were in the other room it was even harder there were sofas' and sofas' Lilly thought that we can jump on one sofa and to the other like that we will get to the entrance so when they did they were in the main entrance. A voice again said you did great you got a 1000 dollars'.

        <h2>The magic school bus</h3>
        <p>One fine day the school students were having fun on the playground
            then a school bus appeared on the playground and made a tornado and took the students to space. When they were there a smart student called ashy said "I can fix the bus but it will take me a whole day" . So they set a camp and a flag and the other students except ashy went to collect some food when they were there they saw a alien and they screamed out "alien alien" and came back to camp ashy said "you silly people those are aliens they won't let you steal their food even if it's a worm you forgot that we have Tiffin's in our backpack's we can eat food from them" so they ate food from their Tiffin's when they were done eating it was night.
                      Aliens came and were trying to attack them so they hid one boy did not get to so the aliens were going to attack him ashy bravely took out a rope that was in her backpack and told the boy "catch the rope" so the boy caught the rope and ashy and the other students pulled and pulled and the boy was in the camp tent. they slept but ashy did not she fix the magic school bus the magic school bus said thank you  here you go you can take a thousand dollars and you can do whatever you want with it" Ashy said "ok I will share it with my friends" the bus said "you are a smart and a brave and of course caring I will take you and your friends back home. In the morning Ashy said "we can go back home I fixed the bus" so they went back home.
